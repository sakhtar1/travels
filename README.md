# TRAVELS

Travels is a travel website, that allows the user to keep track of where they want to travel and where they travelled to, sort of like a bucket list of travel sites. Users can keep track of what continent/country/city they travelled to, and places they've visited in that area. Users also get a view of interesting facts about different continents.
