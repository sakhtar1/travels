# TRAVELS

Travels is a travel website called Travel Door, that allows the user to keep track of where they want to travel and where they travelled to, sort of like a bucket list of travel sites. Users can keep track of what continent/country/city they travelled to, and places they've visited in that area. Users can also log countries they want to travel to and the sites they want to see in the countries on their Bucket List. Interesting facts about different continents are also displayed on the Continents page. 

## Usage

To use this app, clone, bundle install, run rake db:migrate and then run rails server. Everything should be set up. Once you run the server, create your own account, and start adding your travels!
